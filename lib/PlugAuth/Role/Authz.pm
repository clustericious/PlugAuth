=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this role when writing PlugAuth plugins that manage
authorization (ie. determine what the user has authorization
to actually do).

requires qw( 
  can_user_action_resource
  match_resources
  host_has_tag
  actions
  groups_for_user
  all_groups
  users_in_group
);

=head1 REQUIRED ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>can_user_action_resource( $user, $action, $resource )

If $user can perform $action on $resource, return a string containing the 
group and resource that permits this. Otherwise, return false.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>match_resources( $regex )

Given a regex, return all resources that match that regex.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>host_has_tag( $host, $tag )

Returns true if the given host has the given tag.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>actions

Returns a list of actions.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>groups_for_user( $user )

Returns the groups the given user belongs to.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>all_groups

Returns a list of all groups.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>users_in_group( $group )

Return the list of users (as an array ref) that belong to the given group.
Each user belongs to a special group that is the same as their user name
and just contains themselves, and this will be included in the list.

Returns undef if there is no such group.

=head1 OPTIONAL ABSTRACT METHODS

These methods may be implemented by your class.

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>create_group( $group, $users )

Create a new group with the given users.  $users is a
comma separated list of user names.

=cut

sub create_group { 0 }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>delete_group( $group )

Delete the given group.

=cut

sub delete_group { 0 }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>grant( $group, $action, $resource )

Grant the given group or user ($group) the authorization to perform the given
action ($action) on the given resource ($resource).

=cut

sub grant { 0 }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>revoke( $group, $action, $resource )

Revoke the given group or user ($group) the authorization to perform
the given action ($action) on the given resource ($resource)

=cut

sub revoke { 0 }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>granted

Returns a list of granted permissions

=cut

sub granted { [] }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>update_group( $group, $users )

Update the given group, setting the set of users that belong to that
group.  The existing group membership will be replaced with the new one.
$users is a comma separated list of user names.

=cut

sub update_group { 0 }

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>add_user_to_group( $group, $user )

Add the given user to the given group.  If you do not implement this
method, but do implement the C<update_group> method above, then
this method will get the group using C<users_in_group> and
C<update_group>, but there is a race condition if another process
updates the group between these two calls, so it is better to
implement it yourself using whatever native locking mechanism you can.

This method should return the new list of users that belong to the
given group.

=cut

sub add_user_to_group
{
  my($self, $group, $user) = @_;
  my $users = $self->users_in_group($group);
  return 0 unless defined $users;
  push @$users, $user;
  $users = join(',', uniq @$users);
  return $self->update_group($group, $users) ? $users : ();
}

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>remove_user_from_group( $group, $user )

Remove the given user from the given group.  If you do not implement this
method, but do implement the C<update_group> method above, then
this method will get the group using C<users_in_group> and
C<update_group>, but there is a race condition if another process
updates the group between these two calls, so it is better to
implement it yourself using whatever native locking mechanism you can.

This method should return the new list of users that belong to the
given group.

=cut

sub remove_user_from_group
{
  my($self, $group, $user) = @_;
  my $users = $self->users_in_group($group);
  return 0 unless defined $users;
  @$users = grep { lc $_ ne lc $user } @$users;
  $users = join(',', uniq @$users);
  return $self->update_group($group, $users) ? $users : ();
}
